I am a teaching assistant for the following courses at Michigan State University:

- PHY 241: Physics of Cellular and Molecular Biology 1
- PHY 242: Physics of Cellular and Molecular Biology 2

Physics for Cellular and Molecular Biology is a collaborative classroom where the students solve a series of problems on whiteboards and report their results and the reasonings. Our focus is on the concepts of physics that are applicable in the biological sciences.
