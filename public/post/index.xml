      <description>In the summer of 2017 I had the opportunity to go to Tactic, Guatemala. Tactic is a very small village in the mountains of Guatemala, about 7 hours by car from the capital.
Primary Goal: Provide medical and dental care to the children of Tactic. Secondary Goal: Provide funds used to build schools, gardens, and water sanitation systems.
In this small village of Tactic there are numerous children dropping out of schools before the second grade so that they can help provide for their families.</description>
