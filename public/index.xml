      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2017 I had the opportunity to go to Tactic, Guatemala. Tactic is a very small village in the mountains of Guatemala, about 7 hours by car from the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/Tactic_Overlook.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary Goal: Provide medical and dental care to the children of Tactic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary Goal: Provide funds used to build schools, gardens, and water sanitation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this small village of Tactic there are numerous children dropping out of schools before the second grade so that they can help provide for their families. Realizing this is a futile cycle, Impact Ministries has implemented a system that is beneficial to both the child and the family. Their plan is to offer an education to these children for one half of the day and during the other half of the day they work for pay above the average regional wage for adults. Their work entails gardening for a wide variety of vegetables and coffee that will be used during school lunches and sold to the public. These proceeds will support the funds for teachers’ salaries and the general school system. This is a system that has proven to be beneficial to each party, as there have been over five schools built in this mountainous area. Multiple schools are needed so that the commute can be cut to less than an hour and a half walk for 90% of the students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Ministries recruits physicians and dentists to come and provide their skill for the children of Tactic. My role was a scribe to a pediatrician at the main school. Many of these children had general health care needs such as anemia, sight problems, gastritis, and asthma. However some of the children had some rather extreme conditions that needed to be taken care of, especially the infants who’s mothers came from hours away seeking care for their child. During my experience I was able to learn helpful skills such a listening for heart murmurs (which one we found) and taking SOAP notes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience in Guatemala carried a spectrum of emotions. As we were driving to Tactic we were able to see the beautiful landscape, everything from volcanoes to jungles, desert, and mountainous highlands. However, it was crystal clear that most everyone from America lives with a higher standard of living and education than the Guatemalans. I am not talking about having a car or a nice house, I am talking about the ability to go to school and not being forced to work in the fields for a couple dollars per day. The children of Tactic are so ecstatic to go to school that they wake up at 5:00 am in order to walk for 1-2 hours just to arrive on time. Children who, if they became ill or injured would be over 5 hours drive from the nearest hospital with permanent doctors.However, the people of Tactic were the happiest and most generous group of people I have been exposed to. I reflect on these experiences to remind myself to keep a perspective on how hard the trials of life truly are for those not as fortunate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful experience in Guatemala and was further motivated to pursue my academic goals. I believe that Impact Ministries has a wonderful system to benefit all parties, while achieving their goal of discipleship. However, this is one of the reasons that I am working to become a medical professional. I would like to acquire a set of skills that would allow me to make difference in people’s lives and support a group of people that would otherwise go without the essentials of medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
