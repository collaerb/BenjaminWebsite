  <meta name="description" content="Exosomes are nano-sized (30 - 150nm) membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles that arise from inward budding of late endosomes. Exosomes contain proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which can be transmitted to distant cells in a route of intercellular communication. The placenta is a fetally-derived organ responsible for the exchange of oxygen and nutrients to the developing fetus. In humans and rodents, the placenta is in direct contact with maternal blood. Studies have shown that the human placenta secretes exosomes that enter maternal circulation and may therefore impact the function of maternal cells. The overall goal of our studies is to develop and validate a murine model in which the function of pregnancy-associated exosomes can be tested. We have shown that plasma exosome levels during murine pregnancy increase throughout gestation, peaking at gestational day (GD) 14.5 and falling rapidly after birth. In this study, our first goal was to test the hypothesis that the increase in plasma exosomes in pregnancy are placenta-derived. To this end, we used a transgenic reporter mouse model in which wildtype (WT) female mice were bred to a males constitutively and ubiquitously expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), such that resulting fetuses and their placentas also expressed GFP. Exosomes were isolated from maternal plasma using a commercially available precipitation reagent (TEI, Thermo-Fisher). GFP was detected by Western blot in isolated exosomes, confirming the presence of fetus/placenta-derived exosomes in maternal plasma. We next sought to develop a culture system in which placental exosomes could be isolated in large, pure quantities. Placentas from GD14.5-16.5 females were cultured at physiological (8%) or ambient (21%) oxygen conditions for 8 or 24 hours, and evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry, using caspase as a marker of apoptosis-induced cell death. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and evaluated by nanoparticle tracking analysis for size and concentration, as well for morphology by transmission electron microscopy. There was no significant difference in the viability of the placental tissue after explant culture for any condition. Twenty-four hour cultures at ambient oxygen concentration gave the maximal yield for in vitro-derived exosomes. Collectively, these data confirm that the placenta secretes exosomes into the maternal circulation during pregnancy, and that high concentration and quality exosomes can be isolated from placental explant cultures.">

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Exosomes are nano-sized (30 - 150nm) membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles that arise from inward budding of late endosomes. Exosomes contain proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which can be transmitted to distant cells in a route of intercellular communication. The placenta is a fetally-derived organ responsible for the exchange of oxygen and nutrients to the developing fetus. In humans and rodents, the placenta is in direct contact with maternal blood. Studies have shown that the human placenta secretes exosomes that enter maternal circulation and may therefore impact the function of maternal cells. The overall goal of our studies is to develop and validate a murine model in which the function of pregnancy-associated exosomes can be tested. We have shown that plasma exosome levels during murine pregnancy increase throughout gestation, peaking at gestational day (GD) 14.5 and falling rapidly after birth. In this study, our first goal was to test the hypothesis that the increase in plasma exosomes in pregnancy are placenta-derived. To this end, we used a transgenic reporter mouse model in which wildtype (WT) female mice were bred to a males constitutively and ubiquitously expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), such that resulting fetuses and their placentas also expressed GFP. Exosomes were isolated from maternal plasma using a commercially available precipitation reagent (TEI, Thermo-Fisher). GFP was detected by Western blot in isolated exosomes, confirming the presence of fetus/placenta-derived exosomes in maternal plasma. We next sought to develop a culture system in which placental exosomes could be isolated in large, pure quantities. Placentas from GD14.5-16.5 females were cultured at physiological (8%) or ambient (21%) oxygen conditions for 8 or 24 hours, and evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry, using caspase as a marker of apoptosis-induced cell death. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and evaluated by nanoparticle tracking analysis for size and concentration, as well for morphology by transmission electron microscopy. There was no significant difference in the viability of the placental tissue after explant culture for any condition. Twenty-four hour cultures at ambient oxygen concentration gave the maximal yield for in vitro-derived exosomes. Collectively, these data confirm that the placenta secretes exosomes into the maternal circulation during pregnancy, and that high concentration and quality exosomes can be isolated from placental explant cultures.</p>
