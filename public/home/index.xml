      <description>Biography I am and biochemistry and molecular biology student at Michigan State University. In addition to my studies, I have been participating in a research lab and teaching a physics course. I like to spend my free time with outdoor sports, running, or catching up on a new television show. My aspirations are to attend medical school and become trained in orthopedic surgery. I would also like to work with children and pursue a pediatric specialty so I can make a difference in a group that is very important to me.</description>
